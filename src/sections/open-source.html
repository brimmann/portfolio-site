        >: This is component library, specifically designed to reduce
        development time and adhere to pre-defined design and development
        standards. It helps save both money and time. Before making a pull
        request, please contact me first because the design goals may need
        further refinement.

        >: This is development helper library. It helps you build your static
        pages in multiple html files, and during the build time, it will construct
        a fully rendered page for you to deploy. It is more like a
        build-time component-based development. It doesn't add to your website's
        load time because it is only active during development.
